# Machine-Learning-Based-Product-Prediction-System-for-Drop-shipping-
This project focuses on developing a Machine Learning-Based Product Recommendation System for dropshipping platforms. The system uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict whether a product is suitable for dropshipping based on various parameters.

### **Overview**

+ Problem Statement: Dropshippers face challenges in selecting the right products to offer due to the vast product choices available, leading to suboptimal business engagement and limited sales growth.

+ Objective: Develop a machine learning-based system to provide intelligent product recommendations, enhancing dropshippers' decision-making process and business engagement.

+ Solution:
    + Create an interface for dropshippers to input product details.
    + Use a Random Forest Classifier to predict product suitability with an accuracy of 92.47%.
    + Provide accurate recommendations to help dropshippers make informed decisions.


### Here is a list of all the main libraries used in the project, including the GUI library:

1. pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis
2. scikit-learn (sklearn): Used for machine learning algorithms and tools, including the RandomForestClassifier
3. numpy: Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays
4. tkinter: The standard GUI toolkit for Python. It is used to create the user interface for the project
    
I have uplaoded the code by using other alforithms too if you feel that there are some changes needed please contact me
